Problem Statement
    
In a restaurant, if you were pleased by the waiter's service, you may leave him a tip -- you pay him more than the actual value of the bill, and the waiter keeps the excess money. In some countries, not leaving a tip for the waiter is even considered impolite. During my recent holiday I was having dinner in a foreign restaurant. The pamphlet from my travel agency informed me that the proper way of tipping the waiter is the following:
The sum I pay must be round, i.e., divisible by 5.
The tip must be between 5% and 10% of the final sum I pay, inclusive.
Clearly, sometimes there may be multiple "correct" ways of settling the bill. I'd like to know exactly how many choices I have in a given situation. I could program it easily, but I was having a holiday... and so it's you who has to solve this task. You will be given:
an int bill -- the amount I have to pay for the dinner
an int cash -- the amount of money I have in my pocket
Write a function that computes how many different final sums satisfy the conditions above.

Examples

4
100
Returns: 0
4 isn't a round sum, and 5 is too much.
1)

    
23
100
Returns: 1
The only correct choice is to pay 25 dollars, thus leaving a tip of 2 dollars.
2)

    
23
24
Returns: 0
The same bill, but I don't have enough money to leave an appropriate tip.
3)

    
220
239
Returns: 1
This time, it is appropriate to pay either 235 or 240 dollars. Sadly, I don't have enough money for the second possibility.
